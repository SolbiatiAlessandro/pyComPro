This repo contains Competitive Programming tasks solved in Python.

---

<h2> Codeforces </h2>

I will focus on **quality over quantity** trying to find out nice 'tips and tricks' from high rate coders online solving the tasks.

The motivation of the repo is getting my Python fresh and clean since I will be starting working as Python developer pretty soon

<h2>solution-finder.py</h2>

A **tool** to automatically find from codeforces high-quality Python solution to tasks. I wrote this tool to help me find good sources to improve my python skills.

```bash
cd codeforces
python solution-finder.py (number of the contest, e.g. 988) (number of the problem, e.g A)
```

<h2> Leetcode </h2>

- Leetcode "Get well prepared for GOOGLE Interview" (completed)

This are my solutions to Leetcode Google interview preparation, I am writing unit test for every solution since I follow **TDD practices** in order to increase my chances to get Accepted at first submission

Here is a subset of the problems labeled **'hard'** you can find in the repo (not that hard). Had some fun solving them up to beat almost 100% other Python solutions:
 
 - [length of the longest substring with K different elements given a string of chars](https://github.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/pyComPro/blob/master/leetcode/google/332/l332.py)
 - [merge K sorted list](https://github.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/pyComPro/blob/master/leetcode/google/342/l342c.py)
 - [find the First Missing Positive integer in a given array of integers](https://github.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/pyComPro/blob/master/leetcode/google/457/l457.py)
 - [find the k-th smallest difference among all the differences between each item of an array of int](https://github.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/pyComPro/tree/master/leetcode/google/439)

The solutions are organized into folder named with an interger, the integer stands for the problem number from the leetcode link. For example:

"https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/google/63/sorting-and-searching-4/439/" -> leetcode/google/439

For every solution there will be a solution file and a test file, i.e l439.py and test_439.py


- Leetcode "Get well prepared for MICROSOFT Interview" (in progress)

This problems turned out to be way too easy, so I didn't always report them here and just code them up on leetcode.
If you were THAT interested in checking out my solution there too you can always checkout [my leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/alessandrosolbiati/)
