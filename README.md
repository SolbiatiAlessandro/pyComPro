This repo contains Competitive Programming (codeforces) tasks solved in Python.

I will focus on quality over quantity trying to find out nice 'tips and tricks' from high rate coders online solving the tasks.

The motivation of the repo is getting my Python fresh and clean since I will be starting working as Python developer pretty soon
