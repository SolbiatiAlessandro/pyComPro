This repo contains Competitive Programming tasks solved in Python.

<h2> Codeforces </h2>

I will focus on quality over quantity trying to find out nice 'tips and tricks' from high rate coders online solving the tasks.

The motivation of the repo is getting my Python fresh and clean since I will be starting working as Python developer pretty soon

<h2>solution-finder.py</h2>

A tool to automatically find from codeforces high-quality Python solution to tasks. I wrote this tool to help me find good sources to improve my python skills.

```bash
cd codeforces
python solution-finder.py (number of the contest, e.g. 988) (number of the problem, e.g A)
```

<h2> Leetcode </h2>

This are my solutions to Leetcode Google interview preparation, I am writing unit test for every solution since I follow TDD practices in order to increase my chances to get Accepted at first submission

Here is a subset of problems labeled 'hard' (not that hard). Had some fun solving them up to beat almost 100% other Python solutions:
 
 - [length of the longest substring with K different elements given a string of chars](https://github.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/pyComPro/blob/master/leetcode/google/332/l332.py)
 - [merge K sorted list](https://github.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/pyComPro/blob/master/leetcode/google/342/l342c.py)
 - [find the First Missing Positive integer in a given array of integers](https://github.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/pyComPro/blob/master/leetcode/google/457/l457.py)
