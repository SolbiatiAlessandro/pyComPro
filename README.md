I will focus on quality over quantity trying to find out nice 'tips and tricks' from high rate coders online solving the tasks.

The motivation of the repo is getting my Python fresh and clean since I will be starting working as Python developer pretty soon

<h2>solution-finder.py</h2>

A tool to automatically find from codeforces high-quality Python solution to tasks. I wrote this tool to help me find good sources to improve my python skills.

cd codeforces
python solution-finder.py (number of the contest, e.g. 988) (number of the problem, e.g A)
```
